# portfolio_risk_var_cvar
This project implements portfolio risk measurement techniques using Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) on a portfolio of S&amp;P 500 stocks.   The goal is to quantify downside risk, perform stress testing, and visualize risk-adjusted performance under different market conditions.
